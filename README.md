# Multilingual Poetry Generation
## Leveraging Machine Learning to Synthesise Cross-Linguistic Poetic Expressions

This repository contains code and resources for generating poetry in English, Urdu, and Spanish using various machine learning models. The project explores LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, Flatten Model, and CNNs to produce poetic verses, aiming to bridge linguistic and cultural divides through AI.
